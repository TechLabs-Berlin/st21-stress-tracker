# Project Summary

 \
Whether itâ€™s at work, in human interactions or riding a bike in the Berlin traffic, experiencing stress is a regular experience affecting the daily lives of most people. With our Stress Tracker we aim to utilize data collected from wearables and create a machine learning model in order to track, visualize and manage stress levels.
Research has shown that an increased stress level has a negative impact on quality of life and life expectancy by impacting the cardiovascular system. Increased stress level manifests itself in the heart rate. In studies researchers were able to link certain heart rate changes to an increase in stress level.

In a multidisciplinary team consisting of Data Science, User Experience Design and Web Development learners we created a vision to address this problem.
In our vision an app with the following 3 main features help the users to manage their stress effectively:
1. Tracking of stress levels, 2. Notifying users when they are stressed and 3. Providing personalized options for stress reduction
During the project phase we have created our first prototype: a locally hosted web-embedded product. The user can initiate the data transfer with the necessary for the prediction and will receive a stress evaluation. In case of stress the user gets suggestions on how to reduce their stress.
