# Project Summary

 \
**Introduction:**

Whether itâ€™s at work, in human interactions or riding a bike in the Berlin traffic, experiencing stress is a regular experience affecting the daily lives of most people. With our Stress Tracker we aim to utilize data collected from wearables and create a machine learning model in order to track, visualize and manage stress levels. 

**Background:**

Research has shown that an increased stress level has a negative impact on quality of life and life expectancy by impacting the cardiovascular system. Increased stress level manifests itself in the heart rate. In studies researchers were able to link certain heart rate changes to an increase in stress level.

**Methods used:**

We utilized the data from a study monitoring stress level and the subsequent heart rate changes to create several Machine Learning models in Python. Our best model - Random Forest - was implemented in the backend and connected to the Frontend via Flask. React.js was used to create a frontend. The design of the product was created in Figma.

**Result:** \
We have created a locally hosted web-embedded product. The user can initiate the data transfer with the necessary for the prediction and will receive a stress evaluation. In case of stress the user gets suggestions on how to reduce their stress.

**Next Steps:**

In future versions we will include an automated data transfer from the smartwatch, stress notification and a visualization functionality in the app.
